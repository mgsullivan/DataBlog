title: Exploring Energy Data
---

# Hi there!

This blog is going to dive into the data universe for energy production. 

We're going to learn a bit about the pros and cons for each method of production that is used, and then we'll learn about which methods are being used in different parts of the world. Hopefully, when we understand more, we can all exert our own influences as workers, citizens, and consumers to build a world where clean and sustainable energy is plentiful.

We'll talk a bit about data in general, including basic statistics and tools, such as Microsoft Power BI. We also will cover some of the most important public sources for energy data that are out there. This will help anyone else out there who wants to go on their own learning journeys.

Finally, I will likely discuss some of the great work out there that is being done by people and organizations with a lot more experience than I might ever have.

Here is a bit about me. 

My name is Matthew Sullivan. I currently work in the energy industry because I am passionate about making a difference on climate change. I am a bit of an old-dog when it comes to info-tech, having worked for decades as a software engineer, QA tester, support engineer, project manager, and lots of other roles. Most recently, I have become interested in data science and analysis, and I am focusing on building those skills while learning more about about the energy industry.
