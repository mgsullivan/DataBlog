title: Diving into Data - Energy and Power
---

Hi there! 

This blog is going to dive into the data universe for energy production. 

We're going to learn a bit about the pros and cons for each method of production that is used, and then we'll learn about which methods are being used in different parts of the world. Hopefully, when we understand more, we can all exert our own influences as workers, citizens, and consumers to build a world where clean and sustainable energy is plentiful.

Here is a bit about me. My name is Matthew Sullivan. I currently work in the energy industry because I am passionate about making a difference on climate change. I am a bit of an old-dog when it comes to info-tech, having worked for 30 years as a software engineer, QA tester, support engineer, project manager, and lots of other roles. Most recently, I have become interested in data science and analysis, and I am focusing on building those skills while learning more about about the energy industry. 

So we'll also learn a bit about data in general, analytic techniques, and using data analysis tools. My intent is to primarily use Power BI from Microsoft because I have lived in the Microsoft world for most of my career and it feels comfortable. But we also might discuss some other analysis tools. 

We also will cover some of the most important public sources for energy data that are out there. This will help anyone else out there who wants to go on their own learning journeys.

Finally, I will likely point out some of the great work out there that is being done by people and organizations with a lot more experience than I might ever have.
